Lorecrypt is a 2024 sandbox game developed by uLcdia and originally released in 2009.

The game was created by uLcdia in the Java programming language.

# Features
In Lorecrypt, players explore a blocky, pixelated, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain. Players can discover and extract raw materials, debug tools and items, and build structures, frameworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen compile mode, players can fight hostile bugs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Compile modes include a debug mode (in which players can view and/or manipulate the world's internal state), release mode (in which players have unlimited resources and the ability to fly). The game's large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, libraries, algorithm packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.
